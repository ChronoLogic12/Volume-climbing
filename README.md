## About us
 
Volume is a state of the art climbing centre recently opened in the centre of Birmingham. The centre boasts hundreds of routes for both bouldering and lead climbing and offers expert training courses for climbers of all skill levels. They hope to promote themselves as a fun, community driven place where people can come together over a mutual love of climbing. 
 
This website is designed to inform users about the centre and it's available facilities, educate people who are new to the sport of climbing and act as a social media hub and booking service for its users.

## UX Design 
 
### Project Goals
 
Volume has decided to build this website in order to encourage greater traffic to their new Birmingham centre. This website will help facilitate this in a number of ways including:
* Providing an easy way for existing members to find and book times/dates for their climbing sessions.
* Building Volumes overall sense of brand identity. 
* Promoting a greater online presence and generating greater ‘natural traffic’. 
* Encouraging repeat custom by providing a sense of community centered on their service.
* Promoting climbing as a fun and social sport to potential new climbers.
* Making it easy to find details on all services they can provide to both prospective and existing customers.
* Providing a way to easily locate and contact the centre.

### Structure
The website is made up of six pages in total, separated by functionality. This was done with the aim to make any specific information a user might be looking for easily accessible within a small number of clicks and to keep the amount of info per page to a minimum to avoid overwhelming users.
 
### Wireframes
 
Each wireframe contains designs for desktop, tablet and mobile devices.

 ### Responsive design
 
 This site was designed using a 12 column grid layout and displays content responsive based on the users screen size. The site also makes use of smaller resolution images on smaller screens to reduce required bandwidth on mobile devices. 
 
### Colour Scheme
 
The colour scheme I chose for this site is simple but bold. The main, three colour scheme (pictured left to right below) consists of an off black and white colours and a vibrant blue to act as an action colour. The final two colours are pale shades, colour picked from the hero image used on the home page. These colours are used in a linear gradient for the background of the informational pages. This palette gives high contrast without being too aggressive and the limited colour palette helps create a uniform look across all pages. Background images were also dimmed using an opaque gradient of the same off black colour to maintain contrast between background and foreground elements.

## Features 
 
### Existing Features 
 
* Navigation bar
    * The navigation bar is a primary feature of all six pages, it is full width and has a fixed position at the top of the page. This element will allow the user to navigate the site easily without using browser controls and promotes user conversion by prominently displaying the booking button at all times. 
<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/images/readme-images/navbar/navbar-desktop.PNG">
</p>
 
 * On mobile and tablet devices the page navigation links, excluding the booking page link, collapse into a hamburger icon which can be clicked to reveal a full page, vertically oriented, list of navigation links. 
<p align="center">

</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/images/readme-images/navbar/navbar-mobile-open.PNG" width="300px">
</p>
 
* For ease of access, the Volume logo (home button) and the link to the booking page do not collapse into the hamburger icon and are therefor always within easy reach of the user. 
 
 * Footer
    * The footer section is consistent across all pages and contains centre opening hours, basic company contact information, site navigation and social media links. This element is valuable to the user as it provides a consistent, site-wide way of accessing the most common information they may be looking for. It also promotes further browsing through use of site navigation links and externally opening social media links. 
<p align="center">

</p>
 
 * Error 404 page
    * If the user requests a page that does not exist they will instead come to the 404.html page. Here, they will be prompted to return to the sites home page.

#### Home page
 
 * Intro/Hero image
    * This section contains a hero image, displaying a person climbing. This image helps quickly convey the site's topic to a new user and helps promote it in a fun and exciting light. Also prominently displayed is the brand logo helping to build brand identity as well short info cards which can help direct users to more detailed information depending on their needs.

</p>
 
#### Activities page
 
 * Activity breakdown 
    * As part of the activities page, each available activity offered by 'Volume' is presented with a short breakdown of what it entails and an image as demonstration. This is ideal for users who may be new to the sport as it will help them understand what different disciplines are and help them to make decisions about the offered services. 
<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/images/readme-images/activities/activities.PNG" width="600px">
</p>
 
#### Prices page
 
 * Pricing tables
    * The prices page contains costs for all offered services as well as for registration, equipment hire and membership. This is key information for any user considering booking a session and having it easily available and clearly displayed removes potential barriers that might hinder a user from making a booking.
