## About us

Volume is a state of the art climbing center recently opened in the center of Birmingham. The centre boasts hundreds of routes for both bouldering and lead climbing and offers expert training courses for climbers of all skill levels. They hope to promote themselves as a fun, community driven place where people can come together over a mutual love of climbing. 


## UX Design 

### Project Goals

Volume has decided to build this website in order to encourage greater traffic to their new Birmingham centre. The creation of a website will help facilitate this in a number of ways including:
Providing an easy way for existing members to find and book times/dates for their climbing sessions.
Build Volumes overall sense of brand identity. 
Promote a greater online presence and generate greater ‘natural traffic’. 
Encourage repeat custom by providing a sense of community centered on their service.
Promote climbing as a fun and social sport to potential new climbers.
Making it easy to find details on all services they can provide to both prospective and existing customers.
Provide a way to easily locate the centre.
