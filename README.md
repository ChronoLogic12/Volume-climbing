## About us

Volume is a state of the art climbing centre recently opened in the centre of Birmingham. The centre boasts hundreds of routes for both bouldering and lead climbing and offers expert training courses for climbers of all skill levels. They hope to promote themselves as a fun, community driven place where people can come together over a mutual love of climbing. 

This website is designed to inform users about the centre and it's available facilities, educate people who are new to the sport of climbing and act as a social media hub and booking service for its users.

###Bugs

svg files for the brand logo were not displaying. fixed this by using embed tag instead of img. - credit to nisekgao on StackOverflow for the solution - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41195669/images-in-svg-image-tags-not-showing-up-in-chrome-but-displays-locally

had trouble centreing menu icon using position: absolute and left: 50% in a dynamic manner. resolved using "transform:translateX(-50%);" to offset the margin by half the width of the icon.
